                        Enjoy the cable car ride between Joshimath and Gurson (near Auli), that passes over rolling slopes and meandering trails through dense oak forests. One of the highest and the longest ropeways in India, it covers an approximate distance of 4 km amidst the snow-capped mountains with patches of green, offering breathtaking views of the Garhwal mountains.</p>

                    <p>Auli trekking
                      From Auli, one can trek up to Himalayan peaks such as Nanda Devi, Kamat, Mana Parvat and Dunagiri. Joshimath to Auli is about 14 km. Walking on snow-laden paths in winters or lush alpine meadows during summers, the offbeat trails of Auli are an unparalleled attraction for trekkers and nature lovers. The green expanse of Gurson (Gorson) bugyal meadow is just 3 km from Auli and it connects with the trekking trail to Kuari Pass</p>
